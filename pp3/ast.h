/**
 * File: ast.h
 * ----------- 
 * This file defines the abstract base class Node and the concrete 
 * Identifier and Error node subclasses that are used through the tree as 
 * leaf nodes. A parse tree is a hierarchical collection of ast nodes (or, 
 * more correctly, of instances of concrete subclassses such as VarDecl,
 * ForStmt, and AssignExpr).
 * 
 * Location: Each node maintains its lexical location (line and columns in 
 * file), that location can be NULL for those nodes that don't care/use 
 * locations. The location is typcially set by the node constructor.  The 
 * location is used to provide the context when reporting semantic errors.
 *
 * Parent: Each node has a pointer to its parent. For a Program node, the 
 * parent is NULL, for all other nodes it is the pointer to the node one level
 * up in the parse tree.  The parent is not set in the constructor (during a 
 * bottom-up parse we don't know the parent at the time of construction) but 
 * instead we wait until assigning the children into the parent node and then 
 * set up links in both directions. The parent link is typically not used 
 * during parsing, but is more important in later phases.
 *
 * Semantic analysis: For pp3 you are adding "Check" behavior to the ast
 * node classes. Your semantic analyzer should do an inorder walk on the
 * parse tree, and when visiting each node, verify the particular
 * semantic rules that apply to that construct.
